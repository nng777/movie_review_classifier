# ü§ñ Simple Sentiment Analyzer - Your First NLP Application

A beginner-friendly Natural Language Processing (NLP) application that demonstrates core NLP concepts through sentiment analysis. This project shows how to build a machine learning model that can understand whether text expresses positive or negative sentiment.

## üéØ What You'll Learn

- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing text data for analysis
- **Feature Extraction**: Converting text into numerical features using TF-IDF
- **Machine Learning**: Training a Naive Bayes classifier
- **NLP Libraries**: Working with NLTK and scikit-learn
- **Model Evaluation**: Understanding accuracy and confidence scores
- **Real-world Application**: Building a practical sentiment analysis tool

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3.7+**: Programming language
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit for text processing
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone or download this project
# Navigate to the project directory

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Application

```bash
python sentiment_analyzer.py
```

## üìã What the Application Does

### Core Features

1. **Text Cleaning**: 
   - Removes special characters and numbers
   - Converts text to lowercase
   - Removes common stopwords ("the", "is", "and", etc.)
   - Tokenizes text into individual words

2. **Model Training**:
   - Uses sample data to train a sentiment classifier
   - Employs TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for feature extraction
   - Trains a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier
   - Evaluates model performance

3. **Sentiment Prediction**:
   - Predicts whether text is positive or negative
   - Provides confidence scores
   - Compares with VADER sentiment analyzer for validation

4. **Interactive Mode**:
   - Allows you to test your own text
   - Real-time sentiment analysis
   - User-friendly interface

## üîç Understanding the Code

### Key Components

#### 1. Text Preprocessing (`clean_text` method)
```python
def clean_text(self, text):
    text = text.lower()                    # Convert to lowercase
    text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z\s]', '', text)  # Remove special chars
    tokens = word_tokenize(text)           # Split into words
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in self.stop_words]  # Remove stopwords
    return ' '.join(tokens)                # Join back together
```

#### 2. Machine Learning Pipeline
```python
self.model = Pipeline([
    ('tfidf', TfidfVectorizer(max_features=1000, ngram_range=(1, 2))),
    ('classifier', MultinomialNB())
])
```

#### 3. Prediction with Confidence
```python
prediction = self.model.predict([cleaned_text])[0]
probability = self.model.predict_proba([cleaned_text])[0]
confidence = max(probability)
```

Model trained successfully!
Accuracy: 0.67

üéØ Testing predictions:

Text: 'I absolutely love this new product!'

```

## üß† NLP Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. **Tokenization**
Breaking text into individual words or tokens.

### 2. **Stop Word Removal**
Eliminating common words that don't carry much meaning ("the", "is", "and").

### 3. **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**
A numerical statistic that reflects how important a word is to a document in a collection of documents.

### 4. **N-grams**
Contiguous sequences of n words (we use 1-grams and 2-grams).

### 5. **Feature Engineering**
Converting text into numerical features that machine learning algorithms can understand.

### 6. **Supervised Learning**
Training a model on labeled data (text with known sentiments).

### 7. **Classification**
Predicting which category (positive/negative) new text belongs to.

## üéì Educational Benefits

- **Hands-on Learning**: See NLP concepts in action
- **End-to-End Process**: From raw text to predictions
- **Multiple Approaches**: Compare custom model with VADER
- **Interactive Experience**: Test with your own text
- **Real-world Application**: Understand practical uses of sentiment analysis

## üîÑ Extending the Project

### Ideas for Enhancement:
1. Add neutral sentiment category
2. Train on larger datasets
3. Implement different algorithms (SVM, Random Forest)
4. Add text visualization features
5. Create a web interface
6. Analyze social media data
7. Add emotion detection beyond sentiment

## üìö Key Learning Outcomes

After working with this application, you should understand:

- How to preprocess text data for machine learning
- The role of feature extraction in NLP
- How to train and evaluate classification models
- The importance of data quality in NLP applications
- Basic concepts of sentiment analysis
- How to compare different NLP approaches

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **NLTK Data Download**: The app automatically downloads required NLTK data on first run
2. **Low Accuracy**: Normal with small training dataset; would improve with more data
3. **Missing Dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## üß™ Test Examples to Try

Here are various text examples to test with the application to understand different NLP challenges:

### **Clear Positive Examples:**
```
I absolutely love this amazing product!
This is the best experience I've ever had!
Fantastic service, highly recommend to everyone!
Outstanding quality and excellent customer support!
```

### **Clear Negative Examples:**
```
This is terrible and completely useless
I hate this product, worst purchase ever
Awful service, very disappointed with everything
Poor quality, waste of money and time
```

### **Tricky/Challenging Examples:**
```
This movie is not bad
I don't hate it but it's not great either
It's okay I guess, nothing special though
The service was fine but could be better
```

### **Sarcasm/Complex Cases:**
```
Oh great, another wonderful delay!
Yeah right, like that's going to work
Perfect, just what I needed today
Thanks for nothing, really helpful
```

### **Mixed Sentiment:**
```
The movie was okay but the acting was terrible
Great price but poor quality materials
Love the design, hate the functionality
Good service but very slow delivery
```

### **Short/Ambiguous Text:**
```
meh
whatever
ok
fine
sure
enemy
```

### **Negation Examples:**
```
This product is not terrible
I'm not unhappy with the results
It's not the worst thing ever
This doesn't suck completely
```

### **Emotional Context:**
```
I'm so happy I could cry
This is painfully beautiful
I'm dying of laughter
Scared but excited at the same time
```

## üéØ What These Examples Teach

- **Clear cases** show when the model works well
- **Tricky examples** reveal preprocessing limitations
- **Sarcasm** demonstrates context understanding challenges
- **Mixed sentiment** shows single-sentence complexity
- **Short text** reveals data sparsity issues
- **Negation** highlights grammatical complexity
- **Emotional context** shows how words can have different meanings

Try these examples and compare how your custom model performs against VADER!

## üìñ Next Steps

1. Complete the homework assignment (see `HOMEWORK.md`)
2. Test with the examples above and analyze the results
3. Try modifying the preprocessing steps
4. Explore other NLP libraries like spaCy
5. Learn about more advanced NLP techniques
